# Kentucky River Lock & Dam #4
## Franklin County, Kentucky

The original lock and Dam #4 on the Kentucky River was built between the years 1836 to 1842 and was then
rebuilt in 1882 by the Corp of Engineers. The Lock & Dam have since been repaired several time and are still currently operational to leisure boat traffic, though the locks were used until 2002 as a form of transportation of goods by barge.
